    <h3>Java Game 2022</h3>
    <p>
	As part of the Java project at City University we needed to have made a simple 2D game. I opted to go for a simple 2 player game in which incoporates similar features to the well known 'head ball soccer'. The game is an easy yet competitive game where 2 players aim to score past each other and head to the next level. The game tries to capture the 'football' theme as different sound effects and background noises match the approptiate sound. Platforms are placed around the game in which the ball can deflect off and create the uncertainty feel.
